      <h3> Customized AI agent for predicting user behaviors on the computer </h3>
      <p> InfoLab, DGIST, Mar2019-Dec2019</p>
      <p style = "color: #828282"> Developed a customized AI agent for predicting user behaviors on the computer. 
        Developed the end-to-end ML model to predict user intentions from keyboards and mouse input data. 
        Developed a python software that collects and preprocesses user data using macro and socket programming and applied Seq2Seq networks to build a robust AI model that accurately predicts user intentions.<br>

      <h3> Semantic segmentation of 2D surgery image data for intelligent surgical robot vision system </h3>
      <p> Signal Processing Lab, DGIST, Mar2018-Dec2018</p>
      <p style = "color: #828282">Semantic segmentation of surgery images using Unet, a deep convolutional neural network(CNN), 
        for the intelligent surgical robot vision system. Improved the model accuracy by 32% by optimizing the structure of Unet(deep convolutional neural network)
        through the evaluation and regularization of the model including data augmentation and model pre-training.<br>
